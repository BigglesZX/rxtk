h5. php regular expression toolkit

Rxtk is a simple interactive tool to assist in the writing of regular expressions in PHP.

Inspired by the "RX Toolbox" component of the (somewhat expensive) Komodo IDE, Rxtk allows you to edit regular expressions on-the-fly and see the results applied to test text of your choice.

I personally find regex work to be a bit of a brainache at times, so I thought I'd knock up a quick tool to ease some of the pain. Hope you find it useful!
